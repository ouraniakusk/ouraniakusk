Hi, I’m Rania
I’m interested in learning and working in the industry of CS
I have a very basic understanding of HTML and CSS, 
but I am dedicated to learn everything again from 0 and extended
in order to achieve my dream home-office and remote job. 
I tend more to Python and I am intrested to get into beginner friendly projects 
and start buildung my portfolio.
